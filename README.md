Hi, I’m @oltilgo

Despite the fact that I've been messing with computers since amber monitors were the new hotness, I have no coherent understanding of cybertechnology. 
I have never programmed anything more sophisticated than an Apple II.
I’m currently learning how to play with my shiny new Flipper Zero, and it's helping me get over how intimidating this stuff can be.

I'm also on discord, same username.
